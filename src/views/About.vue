    <h1>This is about a Charismatic Codefauna!</h1>
    <p>Passionate about CSS, JavaScript, and it's court of frameworks. Always looking for a way to design a faster load experience.</p>
    <p>Combined with a design background, I'm architecting applications that are usable for people first.</p>
    <p>Starting at my first code job, we were encouraged to teach code classes to others in the business. It made sure we shared our knowledge, and it helped cement what we knew. At least, what we thought we knew.</p>
    <p>Years later, I am still active in my local developer and design groups, sharing and learning.</p>
